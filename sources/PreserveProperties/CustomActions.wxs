        Step 5: Create the custom actions
        ====================================================================================================
        
        These are the two custom actions that store and restore the value of the REMEMBER_ME property
        in/from a temporary property (Temp_REMEMBER_ME).
        
        The two custom actions are configured to be executed only the first time when they are scheduled:
            - Execute="firstSequence"
        
        They must be added in both InstallUISequence and InstallExecuteSequence, but they will be executed
        only once. The first time they are encountered.
